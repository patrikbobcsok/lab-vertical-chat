## Prompts I Tried
1. **Summary Prompt**  
   - Instruction: Summarize into 3 short bullet points.  
   - Result:  
     - Weekend coding club for teenagers started by local community  
     - Volunteers teach Python basics  
     - Attendance doubled in two weeks, schools may offer credit  

2. **Info Grab Prompt**  
   - Instruction: Write person, date, place from the text. If missing, write “unknown.”  
   - Result:  
     Person: Dr. Jamie Lee  
     Date: August 12, 2025  
     Place: Berlin  

3. **Friendly Rewrite Prompt**  
   - Instruction: Rewrite the text as a friendly short email, under 80 words, no new facts.  
   - Result:

## What Didn’t Work So Well
- The model sometimes made the bullet points a little longer than expected.  
- For info grab, it might guess missing values if not told to use “unknown.”  
- The email rewrite once added extra apologies when not asked.

## What I Learned
- Clear rules make the output better (e.g., “exactly 3 bullets”).  
- It helps to say “return only…” so the model doesn’t add extra text.  
- Short, simple instructions are easier for the model to follow.  
- Prompting feels like giving instructions to a person: the clearer and stricter, the better the result.
